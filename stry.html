            <p id="stryp" class="artp">Black to White. Black, all I can see was just black. But why? I can't see anything except black. I thought that I became blind and panicked. I can't move my hands or legs. I am literally in a situation that a deer will be if a lion or whatever is chasing it. But something is amiss. </p>

            <p id="stryp" class="artp">I wanted to be calm and just think about what the hell happening to me, but my panic levels are going to peaks. Suddenly I realized that I am stupid, actually I am not, I actually realized that I closed my eyes. I then relaxed myself and opened my eyes to only see a bright yellow or golden color all around. For a second I thought that I am in heaven and all this is gold. I felt excited. Same uncontrollable feeling I just felt before I opened my eyes, but instead of panic and tension, now I feel happiness, a lot more happiness that I never had in my life or never ever thought of this much.</p>

            <p id="stryp" class="artp">But here is another twist or we can now call it as a full stop for my meaningless uncontrollable feelings. Because I can smell something, a smell I don't dislike but I know it because I have to smell it daily, every day evening. </p>

            <p id="stryp" class="artp">Ah! I got it that's the smell of Lays which my fat friend bought it daily evening, only to eat secretly in the evening study for he thinks' that our teacher will catch him and scold him. But he doesn't know that they all already know about him and they leaved it. 
            Well, leave about him. What about me? I am in nowhere? Why it now smells like potato chips? Wait! I can move my head. I moved my head left and right and discovered that I am on a giant potato chip which was sprinkled with some chili powder all over. And now I saw that I am not just on one chip but a whole packet of Lays filled with nitrogen and the bunch of many giant and gigantic bright colored potato chips. Seeing that gigantic potato chips I am totally confused and shocked too. </p>
            
            <p id="stryp" class="artp">Logical questions raised by my hyper active mind by seeing this scene of chaos. I am completely sullen. This all sucks! Where am I now? Why am I here? I can't digest this rubbish. Okay this is a Lays packet which might bought by my buddy, why the hell is I am here in the packet? Suddenly my stupid mind raised another thought, what if he open the packet and eat me with his ugly decayed teethes? OMG! He is shaking the packet, that means he is going to open it and eat me or throw the seeing me in shock. This moment I became unconscious due to the earthquake of Lays packet. Shaking! Shaking! Shaking!</p>

            <p id="stryp" class="artp">That is it my friend is beside me shaking me because I am sleeping in our evening study and in our desk there is lurking a Lays packet. So, this bloody hell is just a bad dream.</p>
            
            <p id="stryp" class="artp">“Anand sir is asking you a question”, he whispered, but the half of the class hears it and that includes our sir.</p>

            <p id="stryp" class="artp">“Anand how many times do I call your name” our sir said strictly, grasping attention of the whole class.</p>

            <p id="stryp" class="artp">That is it. I am over. I stood up and… nothing, all I can see was just white.</p>
